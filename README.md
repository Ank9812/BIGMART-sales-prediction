# BIGMART-sales-prediction


We will be doing a lot of **data preprocessing and future engineering with a lot of visualization to get
our hands dirty in handling inconsistent datasets.**
Since this is a regression problem, we will also consider several regression algorithms such as the
`linear regression, the decision tree regression, the random forest regress, the SDG booster aggressor`,
as well as other suggestions of other regression algorithms that you can consider, such as the rich
regression, the lasso, the support vector machine regression, the bargain regression, the gradient
boosting, among others.

At the end of the project, you see something like this.

We will start by loading the various libraries necessary for this project.
Then we will load the various files that contains our dataset in form of training data and testing data.
Then we see the head of the data as well.


Moving on, we will perform some data preprocessing to get our data ready for analysis.
We do this in the form of visualization, a lot of different visualization, the form of a plot box
plot and also a histogram to get ourselves familiar with the data that we're dealing with.
As you can see here, we also consider scatterplot to see the relationship that is existing among the
various features that we have in our dataset.
We also consider the correlation that is existing in the form of a heat map.
Then comes the future engineering and future transformation.

Over here, we will take our time to look into the various features that we have in our dataset, then

perform a lot of feature engineering to get our data ready for further analysis and building our model.
